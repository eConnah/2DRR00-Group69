Exercise 1 \emph{Food Ratings}

\section{Introduction}
We chose to use different, unrelated items from the McDonalds menu as we wanted to select a topic everyone had tried. The items we chose were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Big Mac
    \item Fillet-O-Fish
    \item McNuggets
    \item McFlurry (Oreo)
    \item Apple Pie
    \item Egg McMuffin
    \item Side Salad
    \item Hash Browns
\end{itemize}

We then all rated the items from -2 to 2 and stored them in json files so they could be used as vectors later on.
After choosing Glorija as our person to estimate we then calculated the similarity of her answers to everyone elses for the first 4 items using
the following formula:
$$\text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{a \cdot b}{\| a \| \| b \|}$$
Using this formula, values close to 1 indicate strong similarity, values near 0 indicate no relationship, and values approaching -1 indicate strong opposition.
