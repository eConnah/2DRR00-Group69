\title{Google Page Rank}

We decided to go with a map of airports and flights between them for the Google Page Rank with the following airports.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Amsterdam
    \item Barcelona
    \item Berlin
    \item Bratislava
    \item Eindhoven
    \item Frankfurt
    \item London
    \item Maastricht
    \item Paris
    \item Prague
    \item Riga
    \item Tallinn
    \item Vilnius
\end{itemize}

The flights connections are not based on real data and are meant to represent a part of the day (the reason for the many one-way flights).

We first create the matrix G with values 1 or 0 depending on whether there is a flight from the row-city to the column-city (e.g g_1,2 = 1, as there is a flight from Amsterdam to Barcelona). 

We normalize the matrix using G = \frac{G}{||G||_1}. We then compute a column-stochastic matrix A, using A = p \cdot G\norm + (1 - p) \cdot \frac{1}{13} \cdot \1_{13}, where \p is the probability of continuing to another airport, instead of "randomly teleporting" (taking a train, bus etc.)

We proceed to computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors and filter to the first eigenvector with \lambda = 1. We then normalize this eigenvector x_n = \frac{|x|}{\sum_{i=1}^{13}|x_i|} and round the values to 2 decimal places.

We can adjust the p-value for different results.
